We've just added some attributes, for the sake of demonstrating how to address 
them with XPath.

How Do Templates Affect the Context Node?
An important point to remember in XSLT is that whatever 
the template uses for its match attribute becomes 
the context node for that template. This means that 
all XPath expressions within the template are relative 
to that node. Take the following example:

<xsl:template match="/order/item">
    <xsl:value-of select="part-number"/>
</xsl:template>

This template will be instantiated for any <item> element that is a child of an <order> element that is a child of the document root. That <item> element is now the context node for this template, meaning that the XPath expression in the <xsl:value-of> attribute is actually only selecting the <part-number> element which is a child of the <item> element already selected for this template.
