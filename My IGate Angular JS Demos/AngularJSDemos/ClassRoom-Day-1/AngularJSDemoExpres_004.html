<!-- Angular initializes automatically upon DOMContentLoaded event or

 when the angular.js script is evaluated if at that time document.readyState is set to 'complete'. 

At this point Angular looks for the ng-app directive which designates your application root. 

If the ng-app directive is found then Angular will:

Load the module associated with the directive.
Create the application injector
Compile the DOM treating the ng-app directive as the root of the compilation. 


This allows you to tell it to treat only a portion of the DOM as an Angular application. -->
