<!-- These factories are all created through the $provide service, which is responsible for instantiating
these providers at run time.
A provider is an object with a $get() method. The $injector calls the $get method to create a new
instance of the service. The $provider exposes several different API methods for creating a service,
each with a different intended use.
At the root of all the methods for creating a service is the provider method. The provider() method
is responsible for registering services in the $providerCache.
Technically, the factory() function is shorthand for creating a service through the provider()
method wherein we assume that the $get() function is the function passed in.
The two method calls are functionally equivalent and will create the same service. -->
