If we want to write a pseudo  code for
input 10 numbers, and print their total  but any numbers>100
 should be ignored, i.e should not be summed.
 Which of the following seems to be  a correct pseudo code  for  the
 above requirement?
	BEGIN
		DECLARE sum=0
		FOR n=1 TO 10
			ACCEPT number
			IF number<=100
				sum=sum+number
			ENFIF
		ENDFOR
		DISPLAY sum
	END;


	BEGIN	
		DECLARE sum=0
		FOR n=1 TO 10
			ACCEPT number
			IF number>=100
				sum=sum+number
			ENFIF
		ENDFOR
		DISPLAY sum
	END;
		
	
	BEGIN	
		DECLARE sum=0
		FOR n=1 TO 10
			ACCEPT number
			IF number==100
				sum=sum+number
			ENFIF
		ENDFOR
		DISPLAY sum
	END;
		
	BEGIN
		DECLARE sum=0
		FOR n=1 TO 10
			ACCEPT number
			IF number<=100
				sum=sum+number			
			ENDFOR
		ENFIF
		DISPLAY sum
	END;
